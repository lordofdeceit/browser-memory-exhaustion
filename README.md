# browser-memory-exhaustion
For this project I intend to create a website that when visited opens too many tabs since pop ups however fun would not work as browsers block them.
Ttha tabs are meant to use up all your memory thus crashing your system, nothing a hard restart can't fix tho but quite some prank tho.
this project is inspired by the famous fork bomb and would love to see its use in modern world.
definitely not something too nefarious with severe issues but nice way to annoy and inconvenience someone.
a browser version is quite good, theres also a similar project already and for the initial stages some similarities with it may arise.
For this project I was inspired by this fantastic fork-bomb list:

also by the forkbomb site by (https://github.com/JonnyBanana/HTML-Fork-Bomb) with his project accessible at : https://jonnybanana.github.io/HTML-Fork-Bomb.github.io/
