# browser-memory-exhaustion
this is a test probably fun project that im trying to create that when you send a link it automatically opens too many tabs consecutively and exhausts your system memory.
this project is inspired by the famous fork bomb and would love to see its use in modern world.
definitely not something too nefarious with severe issues but nice way to annoy and inconvenience someone.
a browser version is quite good, theres also a similar project already and for the initial stages some similarities with it may arise.
For this project I was inspired by this fantastic fork-bomb list:

https://github.com/aaronryank/fork-bomb
also by the forkbomb site by (https://github.com/JonnyBanana/HTML-Fork-Bomb) with his project accessible at : https://jonnybanana.github.io/HTML-Fork-Bomb.github.io/
